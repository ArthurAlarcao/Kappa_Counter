2016-01-02T21:01:36.831473Z happyphotocopy: maybe, whats up Quinneroonigaming
2016-01-02T21:02:01.003081Z chlenososik: your problem is that you are not HYPED Kappa
2016-01-02T21:02:02.460169Z fantoser: I may can help
2016-01-02T21:02:32.127156Z quinneroonigaming: Whenever I try to record/stream it just stays on the screen it started on, so if I started the stream on the pause menu and start playing, the viewers will see the pause menu.
2016-01-02T21:02:35.196128Z executiveproton: HYPE doomsdayChamp

2016-01-02T21:03:02.372434Z tombstoun: tri1 tri2 tri3 tri4
2016-01-02T21:03:03.657840Z happyphotocopy: does everything freeze up or just the game?
2016-01-02T21:03:14.226303Z happyphotocopy: if you have a webcam, does it continue to operate correctly or does it freeze
2016-01-02T21:03:16.112833Z fantoser: One like to Tombstoun
2016-01-02T21:03:33.176535Z fantoser: tri3
2016-01-02T21:03:34.262708Z happyphotocopy: is it frozen in your obs video preview too or only in what is sent to twitch? or both?
2016-01-02T21:03:42.466492Z downcheater12: lets ee how long will be the slowmode after the first day of agdq XD

2016-01-02T21:04:07.524121Z quinneroonigaming: On my video preview as well and also I don't use a webcam
2016-01-02T21:04:20.519297Z defensior: Hehe, I know, just playin'
2016-01-02T21:04:22.311548Z happyphotocopy: damn
2016-01-02T21:04:34.083283Z happyphotocopy: that would have been a good thing to test against
2016-01-02T21:04:34.463568Z chlenososik: your OBS is not HYPED Keepo
2016-01-02T21:04:42.307682Z happyphotocopy: Quinneroonigaming so what kind of capture source?
2016-01-02T21:04:54.968548Z quinneroonigaming: @Happyphotocopy where do I check?
2016-01-02T21:05:02.163520Z rek3dge: forsen subs forsenC
2016-01-02T21:05:07.254513Z happyphotocopy: at the bottom of the main window there's sources, scenes, and some buttons
2016-01-02T21:05:16.221736Z happyphotocopy: under sources there should be a source that represents your game screen
2016-01-02T21:05:22.641941Z chlenososik: Are you on MAC or PC?
2016-01-02T21:05:26.470894Z happyphotocopy: i'd like you to find out if it was a window capture, monitor capture, game capture
2016-01-02T21:05:27.678798Z quinneroonigaming: PC
2016-01-02T21:05:33.970615Z happyphotocopy: or tell us if you're using a capture card to capture a console
2016-01-02T21:05:35.820045Z snapcasters: Hey another random question: Anyone know any good, free apps to use to stream music to OBS that supports showing album art + artist info?
2016-01-02T21:05:51.384372Z quinneroonigaming: @Happyphotocopy game capture.
2016-01-02T21:05:58.975234Z happyphotocopy: Snapcasters i use foobar2000 as my music player and i use "Snip" to capture foobar2000's title bar
2016-01-02T21:06:10.325635Z happyphotocopy: and i changed foobar2000's titlebar in it's settings to show only artist - track name
2016-01-02T21:06:14.318728Z snipez5546: Cant wait for AGDQ
2016-01-02T21:06:26.744312Z happyphotocopy: Quinneroonigaming try another capture type such as window or monitor capture and tell me if the issue persists
2016-01-02T21:06:34.845582Z chlenososik: cant wait for bonus stream Kappa
2016-01-02T21:06:39.966201Z chauzu_vgc: So how much time is left Kappa
2016-01-02T21:06:43.891148Z happyphotocopy: Quinneroonigaming by the way is sound frozen as well or just picture?
2016-01-02T21:06:47.262529Z quinneroonigaming: @Happyphotocopy Ok, thx for the advice
2016-01-02T21:06:51.193341Z chlenososik: 1 hour Keepo
2016-01-02T21:07:03.361919Z defensior: It would be awesome if the bonus stream was a bit longer this year - seemed super short for SGDQ
2016-01-02T21:07:12.769267Z quinneroonigaming: @Happyphotocopy let me record something to check, I'm pretty sure sound is fine, though.
2016-01-02T21:07:12.983857Z nichard__rixon: 28 minutes :)
2016-01-02T21:07:20.096309Z nichard__rixon: jk
2016-01-02T21:07:32.888595Z chauzu_vgc: AGDQ has become so sellout DansGame I'll probs just watch what interests me
2016-01-02T21:08:11.373426Z defensior: If it gets more money to charity, personally I don't mind that
2016-01-02T21:08:33.678749Z chauzu_vgc: Well the charity is very suspicious
2016-01-02T21:08:55.955738Z defensior: How so?
2016-01-02T21:09:02.929844Z quinneroonigaming: @Happyphotocopy should I try monitor capture WITH game capture or just monitor capture?
2016-01-02T21:09:33.537998Z chauzu_vgc: It doesn't fully disclose where all money goes to, and a lot of the money goes to awareness in USA, which doesn't help rest of the world
2016-01-02T21:09:46.833881Z happyphotocopy: Quinneroonigaming monitor capture or game capture or window capture. Don't combine them, only use one at a time. Un-checking the source for the one you already have is fine, you don't have to delete the sources you create if you don't want to
2016-01-02T21:10:10.176002Z quinneroonigaming: @Happyphotocopy Ok
2016-01-02T21:10:11.989390Z chlenososik: Kappa
2016-01-02T21:10:19.226692Z chlenososik: spaaaam Keepo
2016-01-02T21:11:10.649008Z defensior: @Chauzu_VGC Hmm, point taken
2016-01-02T21:11:37.448734Z filurr: So the charity will only benefit North Americans?
2016-01-02T21:11:58.208105Z defensior: But is there actually a global cancer charity in existence?
2016-01-02T21:15:25.252907Z tombstoun: sodapoppin's stream

2016-01-02T21:20:02.270834Z happyphotocopy: also that zeldathon room is very small
2016-01-02T21:20:21.911813Z tompa: They aren't 1000 attendees afterall :)

2016-01-03T07:23:11.160245Z atheistman4: and regular speedrunners have been incorporating an artistic flair for a long time
2016-01-03T07:23:31.990512Z d0og: Hmm, "TAS" apeals to the sense of power, that allows for one to further "pretend" they are the speed runner.
2016-01-03T07:23:39.282738Z mkwgino: is there a TASbot this year?

2016-01-03T07:27:04.365201Z d0og: The, "Your Amazing" factor, will dictate that TAS runs come near the end, to bring people back in and say, "Wow, your all so amazing for doing all these speed runs".
2016-01-03T07:27:09.325274Z ninjalink64: What if TASBot draws Bob Ross or something lmao.
2016-01-03T07:27:10.448967Z atheistman4: but if you think that there is no skill or artistry in tasing, as it seems you do, you should know that many of the biggest glitches utilized by speedrunners have been found by tasers
